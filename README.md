This project, name "TA" (for Teaching Assistant), serves for educational and productvitiy purposes for the AngelHack 2018, 
based on https://github.com/falvaro/seshat, whose open-source research work we recognize and credit and acts as the foundation
on which we develop.

We expanded the functionality of the original code base by introducing on-going recognition functionality to enable
live scientific equation calculations and automatic completions.
